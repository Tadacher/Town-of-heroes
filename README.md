# Town of heroes

Welcome to the treacherous world of Aranthia, a land filled with dangerous monsters and treacherous magic. You are the wizard, that accidentially teleported your town to the wild lands. Now you must use all of your cunning and strategy to protect it from the hordes of enemies that seek to destroy it.

But this is no ordinary tower defence game. Town of heroes is a hardcore roguelite, where every playthrough is different and death is permanent. You must carefully manage your resources and choose your battles wisely, as even the smallest mistake could lead to your demise.

As you journey through the game, you will encounter a wide variety of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some will attack from afar with magic spells, while others will charge headlong at you with brute force. You must use a combination of towers, traps, and your own combat skills to repel them all.


As you progress through the tower, you will uncover the dark history of Aranthia and unlock new characters, towers, spells, skills and muck more!

Do you have what it takes to defend the Tower of Heroes and uncover the secrets of Aranthia? Only the bravest and most skilled defenders will survive this hardcore fantasy roguelite tower-defence game.
